Getting recipe info using JSON

category images were a bit odd to work with as there is no standard size or shape. think the list of recipies in that category is much more visually appealing than the main page. 

got images and text to show. For some reason struggling to decode the final recipie section. Seems very similar to the rest of the JSON so dont know why my attempts didnt show the data. I tried a few different ways in the playground. ended up just making a standard template.
